this is NetWork socket homework(1)

we can see how to send message to the clawer, and send what the clawer can show it.

such like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: len
```

And then you should send the message whose length is len.


if can't find the file, then send 'HTTP/1.1 404 Found'
